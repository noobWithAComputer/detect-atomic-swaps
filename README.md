# detect-atomic-swaps
As a project for university I developed some go scripts to detect Atomic Swaps on BTC-like blockchains.

The task was to describe the functionality of atomic swaps, identify typical forms and evaluate how atomic swaps can be detected and matched.

I added the thesis, so you can get an understanding of atomic swaps.
Sadly the scripts won't work out of the box for you, because I used a library of my supervisor which is not public.
As far as I know it is a clone of btcsuite/btcutil which was customized to work with btc, bch, ltc, dcr, dgc, doge, stak, vtc and xzc.

At the moment I won't have the time to rewrite the scripts to work without the modified btcutil library...

I plan to translate the thesis to english to make it available to more people.
Now there is just the german version.
